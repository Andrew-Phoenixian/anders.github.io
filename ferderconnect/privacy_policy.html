  <p><strong>Information Collection and Use</strong></p>
  <p>
    For a better experience, while using our Service, I
    may require you to provide us with certain personally
    identifiable information, including but not limited to e-mail address, phone number, name, address and hometown.
    This information besides name are changable and viewable by the user.
    This information is already provided from the already registered
    information through the TDS-client for the buisness.
    Change of information through this app will not alter
    information from TDS, as that is a different service of a
    different system.
