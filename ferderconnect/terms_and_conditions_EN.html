    property rights, remain the property of the FerderConnect Development team.

  <p>
    The FerderConnect Development team is dedicated to providing a useful and efficient app experience. Therefore, we

    Please note that certain features of the app may require an active internet connection. The connection can be Wi-Fi
    or provided by your mobile network provider. However, FerderConnect Development team cannot be held responsible if
    the app does not function at its full capacity if you do not have access to Wi-Fi or if you have exhausted your data
    allowance.

  <p>
    As you use the FerderConnect app, please keep in mind that while we strive to ensure its accuracy and timeliness, we
    do rely on third-party information to provide the app's functionality. Therefore, FerderConnect Development team cannot
    be held liable for any loss or damage incurred as a result of solely relying on the app.
  </p>
  <p>
    Additionally, when using the app outside of a Wi-Fi area, please be aware that your mobile network provider's terms
    and conditions still apply. You may incur charges for data usage while accessing the app, and FerderConnect
    Development team cannot be held responsible for these charges. If you use the app outside of your home territory, you
    may also incur roaming data charges. If you are not the bill payer for the device on which the app is being used,

    The FerderConnect app may be updated from time to time to improve performance and add new features. These updates
    may require you to download the latest version of the app to continue using it. However, FerderConnect Development team
    cannot guarantee that the app will always be compatible with your device's operating system or that updates will be
    released in a timely manner. Additionally, FerderConnect Development team reserves the right to discontinue the app at
